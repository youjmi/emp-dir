## Description

Welcome to Eddy, the Employee Designated Directory! I have created a employee directory with React. This assignment requires me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. Any user who is an employee to your company will be able to view the entire employee directory at once so that he/she/they will have quick access to their information.

Eddy is very user friendly. The user is able to type any existing property and the search individual will show up immediately. The user is also able to sort through in an ascended fashion by clicking on the top of each column.
